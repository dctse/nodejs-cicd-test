# drone-cicd-nodejs
CICD demo app (nodejs)

This app is used to demonstrate how drone.io can be used for CI/CD under a cncf-ecosystem setup.
It contains a skeleton NodeJS app using a KoaJS library for a typical web server.
It includes eslint for linting and mocha/chai for testing

Of notable interest will be how `.drone.yml` runs linting and testing
